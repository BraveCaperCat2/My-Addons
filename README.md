# A Collection Of BraveCaperCat's addons for minecraft bedrock edition - Java Edition mods will not be included here, instead in their own seperate repo (one per mod)
Each addon is in the .mcaddon format which can be directly imported into minecraft by double clicking (on windows) or whatever you would usaully use to open a file on your operating system.

They are stored in the "popular zip format" so you can change their extension to .zip and see what's inside (i did the opposite to make them)
